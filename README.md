# BootAnim9
Custom boot animations for A9LH

# How to install
Compile with 'make' and copy the resulting arm9loaderhax.bin to your SD card root directory.
Generate your custom animation(s) and copy it/them to your SD card root as sdmc:/anim and sdmc:/bottom_anim

After displaying the animations, it will load and launch sdmc:/arm9payload.bin, so make sure to have an ARM9 payload sitting there!

# How to generate a custom animation
This process ***requires*** **ffmpeg** with the "transpose" video filter and an animated image with size 400x240 or 320x240.

You can use this command to scale a file, and perform needed operations (as an example):
>ffmpeg -an -i <FILENAME> -r 30 -pix_fmt bgr24 -vf "scale=400x240,transpose=1" output.rgb

>*Framerate is recommended to be between 5 and 30, and both animations must have* ***the same framerate***

Copy the resulting output.rgb to sdmc:/anim/anim or sdmc:/anim/bottom_anim, edit your configuration file to reflect framerate changes, and *voila*!

Please note that if you want to create a bottom screen animation, you have to use a 320x240 image instead of 400x240.

# How to set framerate

Inside the anim directory there should be a 'config' file. The sole purpose of this file is to indicate the framerate of **
