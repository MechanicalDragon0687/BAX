BAX ALPHA:

 w00t finally a stable way to run code on the MPCore... too bad there's barely any hw documentation
 for it, at least any accessible by regular users (non-ARM-licensees $_$)

 requires dkA (only tested with r47) and firmtool
 
 code written by me is licensed under the MIT license, fatfs is licensed under a BSD-like license
 so it's fine, sdmmc is licensed under the MPL license so it's okay to redistribute binaries if
 you also distribute hw/sdmmc.{c,h} (I think).
