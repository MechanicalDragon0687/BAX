BAX ALPHA:

 it's mostly unfinished because I gotta deal with some shit from b9s but at least the main
 subsystems work fine and the only real assumptions I make about the system are that all memory
 is accessible as usual and that ITCM is mirrored throughout the lower 128 megs of the address
 space. there's an ARM11 stub that does some GPU configuration, clears VRAM and sets up the
 cakehax framebuffers. it requires either 0x1FFFFFF8 or 0x1FFFFFFC to accept the ARM11 entrypoint
 thingy so it should be compatible with both a9lhsi and b9s as entrypoint (although once booted only
 0x1FFFFFFC is usable).

 read makeanim.py and source/anim/bax.h for an overview of the system.

 code written by me is licensed under the MIT license, fatfs is licensed under a BSD-like license
 so it's fine, sdmmc is licensed under the MPL license so it's okay to redistribute binaries if
 you also distribute hw/sdmmc.{c,h} (I think).

 feel free to make issues/PRs if you feel *anything* can be improved upon that hasn't been suggested
 yet
