- testing, lots of it

- move the ARM9 code to ITCM and data/bss to DTCM

- add firmlaunch code to ARM9 (need more documentation...)

- figure out EMMC + NDMA (dope af, maybe nocash knows?)

- simplify the animation logic (vblank instead of timer, early cutout)

- verify stereoscopic animations actually do work as intended

- improve the build system (common source code, rebuilds, etc)

- write a transcoder, best candidate so far is python3

- enable N3DS extra cache and FCRAM and higher freq

- try to play audio?

- more testing
